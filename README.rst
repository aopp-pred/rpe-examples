Reduced precision emulator examples
===================================

The intent of this repository is to collect useful examples of how rpe_ can be
used to perform numerical experiments with reduced floating-point precision.

Examples:
---------

* shallow_water:

  A shallow-water equation model on an Arakawa C-grid
